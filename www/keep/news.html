<h3 align="center">News</h3>

<p> May 20, 2008
<ol>
<li> New siRNA search pattern has been added to website.
<li> Up-to-date SNPs for the siRNAs in human and rat have been added.
<li> For each siRNA candidate, a list of potential miRNA targets is shown.
</ol> 


<p> August 6 2004
<ol>
<li> More sensitive <a href="http://blast.wustl.edu/blast">WU BLAST</a> has been added.</li>
<li> Users can BLAST NCBI RefSeq and Ensembl Transcript databases in additional to UniGene database.
<li> Rat in addition to human and mouse database are added.
<li>"Best hit" has been removed. Instead the program will search our local databases to find corresponding Gene ID for your target sequence's accession/gi number. </li>
<li>In the BLAST result page, you can further filter out non-specific siRNAs to reduce off-target effects.</li>
</ol>


<p> May 21 2004
<ol>
<li>We support Safari browser in addition to Internet Explorer and Netscape</li>
<li>The positions 1-20 of the antisense siRNA are used for BLASTing. Alignment of BLAST results is shown at 5'-> 3' direction.</li>
</ol>

<p> Jan.30 2004</p>
<ol>
<li>Thermodynamic values for each siRNA are calculated based on the papers published at <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=14567917&dopt=Abstract" target="new"> Zamore's lab </a>and by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=14567918&dopt=Abstract" target="new"> Khvorova <i>et.al.</i></a></li>
<li>Filters: siRNAs can be filtered with any number of consecutive G/C.</li>
<li>Sort function have been added. Users can sort their siRNAs by many criterias: such as thermodynamic values, BLAST results, GC% <i>etc</i>. </li>
<li>Better format in the result page. For each siRNA, all its BLAST results are condensed into one file and linked to it.</li>

</ol>

<p> Sep. 15 2003</p>
<ol>
<li>siRNA patterns: NARN17YNN and NANN17YNN have been removed.</li>
<li>Filters: 'no more than 3 of the same base in a row' has been removed. 'exclude a run of 4 or more T or A in a row' has been added to the website.</li>
<li>Results: more genes with similar alignments with siRNA are included.</li>
<p> For more information, please refer to the links in the user input page.
</ol>


<p> Feb. 26 2003</p>
<ol>
<li>You can input either a raw sequence or a fasta format sequence in the sequence field.</li>
<li>You can now receive your results from the web directly and/or from email. Email is no longer the only option to receive results.</li>
<li>Bugs in delivering some email results have been corrected.</li>
</ol>
