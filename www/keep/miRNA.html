<h3 align="center">miRNA</h3>
All the possible 7mers (position 2 to 8 in antisense strand) have been mapped to all the 3'UTR conserved regions among human, mouse, rat, dog and chicken. For each siRNA candidate, the number of genes that the 7mer miRNA seed could potentially bind to and the occurrence ratio are displayed.  For example for 1579[99]: the 1579 means the miRNA seed (7mer) could potentially bind to 1579 genes, [99] means that 99% of all 7mers would potentially bind to no more than 1579 of the genes.  In other words, only 1% of all 7mers would potentially bind to more than 1579 genes.  The link gives detailed information on the potentially targeted genes.  <br />

This can be very useful for explaining the off-target effect in the siRNA experimental results.
